                     <p>This simple Cucumber sandwich recipe is perfect to prepare as a light snack or lunch. It’s easy to make and great for customizing with your favorite ingredients, like tomatoes, cheese, and/or herbs. Really great appetizer for the summer or anytime. Every time I have served these everyone wants the recipe...and they're so easy! Just be sure to refrigerate the cream cheese mixture overnight! </p>
